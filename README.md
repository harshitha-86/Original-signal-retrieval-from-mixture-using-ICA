# Unsupervised Learning
## Project: Retrieval of original signals from a mix using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in Machine Learning.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.6** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Independent Component Analysis Lab.ipynb
```

or

```bash
jupyter notebook Independent Component Analysis Lab.ipynb
```
This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Dataset

We have three WAVE files, each of which is a mix

### Independent Component Analysis (ICA)

Independent component analysis attempts to decompose a multivariate signal into independent non-Gaussian signals. As an example, sound is usually a signal that is composed of the numerical addition, at each time t, of signals from several sources. The question then is whether it is possible to separate these contributing sources from the observed total signal.
